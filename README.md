# Q: Why doesn't this ship with a custom map?
## A: Personally, I see specialty maps as a flaw, since your gamemode will only be as successful as the community efforts behind it when the base map gets redundant. From the get-go, I wanted to design this to be map-independent experience. But, here are the [hand-picked, curated maps that I believe provide a cohesive and unified experience best with this gamemode.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1096585195) But then again, the beauty of this is, you can use any map you imagine. The possibilities are endless!


### Written with developers in mind. Core features are compartmentalized and implemented as modules, with as many hooks as one could possibly hope to change default gamemode behaviour.
